Task S1.07.Annotations

📄 Description

This project consists of developing and practicing the concept of Annotations in Java. In this case we use two types of annotation, "@Override", that ensures a method correctly overrides a method from a superclass or implements an interface method, and, 
"@Deprecated", that marks a code element (class, method, field) as obsolete, indicating it should no longer be used.
